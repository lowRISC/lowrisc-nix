Subject: [PATCH 1/2] Set FUSE entry expiration time

Currently entry expiration is not set, which means that the dentry is
thrown away after each use, causing significant overhead since every
lookup operation needs to call into userspace.

Entry captures the mapping from file name to inode. The kernel list
cache option allows readdir response to be cached, which is also
dentry, so I reuse the same TTL for entry expiration timeout.
This is conservative, and I am pretty sure there can be further
performance improvement by setting the expiration in more cases (as the
object generation number is also cached).

There are a few other places where dentry is returned, e.g. create or
mkdir, but since the cache is more useful for readonly/read-mostly FS, I
didn't bother setting the dentry expiration time for these calls.

This change brings significant performance improvement due for readonly
workloads.
* I tested the change with a bucket that have 6000 files, using `du -hs`
  on the directory (it will stat all the files.). I ran the command once
  to populate the cache, and then time the second run. The change
  reduces time taken by the command from 532ms to 72ms.
* I also tested the change in a production compilation workload. The
  time taken for each run reduces from 7 minutes to 1 minute.

Subject: [PATCH 2/2] Enable negative dentry caching

This can bring perf improvement in compilation workload where the
compiler searches for headers.
